WeatherStation

This script runnng the weither station is divided into various tabs, where each sensor is contained in a single tab.
The files are loaded alphabetically (after this file), where files starting with an underscore are opened last.
Therefore, the Setup() and Loop() functions are put in the Main file, which is loaded after all sensor-functions have been prepared.
