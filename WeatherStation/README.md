# WeatherStation

## Introduction
The *Weather station* is an external hub which collects weather-relevant data and transmit the collected data to the main unit. The station is connected with various sensors to collect data (temperature, humidity, pressure and lumosity) and transmit the data via a 433 MHz transmitter (EU only). The station uses a low-cost Arduino Pro Mini (3.3V) and is powered by a LiPo battery. The station is automatically turned off once the battery is almost empty to extend the lifetime.

## Components
- Adruino Pro Mini (3.3V)
- BME280 temperature, pressure & humidity sensor
